## 🚀 Features

* **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
* **Collapsible Sidebar (Mobile):** The sidebar transforms into an off-canvas menu, toggled by a hamburger button (`☰`) on screens $\leq 768$px.
* **Dynamic Content Loading:** Content for different sections (`Home`, `About`, `Services`, etc.) is loaded into the main area using **JavaScript** without full page reloads.
* **Active Tab Indication:** The currently selected sidebar item is highlighted with the class `active-tab`.
* **Basic Header:** Includes a menu button, navigation links, and a login button.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structural markup (`index.html`).
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and media queries (`style.css`).
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For interactivity, including sidebar toggling and content switching (`script.js`).
